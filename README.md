# SunBakery

## ðŸ“ŒInformation
This is the SunBakery website. This is a project that I created to deepen and also improve my skills in using React Typescript. This project also uses MUI and Styled Components.

I made this website responsive enough to be viewed from various media sizes. In this SunBakery website, I created three pages, namely home, store, and contact. This bakery website has several types of bread and on the product page, users can see product details and add products to the basket.
